User data is not collected, stored, shared, or otherwise redistributed.
The only reason we even have Users sign-in is so that everyone can have fair and consistent experience.
Tsar-Dev as an entity, and I, Tony Rito, as its owner, do not believe that the collection of user data is just, nor necessary.
There will be no intrusive advertisement, and there will be no marketing pitches.
We just want everyone to have fun.

Thank you for your concern,
Ton Rito, Tsar Dev
